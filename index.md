# Raspigam project site

An IT education project in the Gambia using the Raspberry Pi single board computer

## Where?

At the Computer Lab of Sanyang Lower Basic School.

## Who?

The project is led by teacher Ebrima S. Jallow (GM) and IT professional Rob van den Bogaard (NL).

## Why?

Because the Raspberry Pi is a not so expensive, powerful, versatile and serious computer that enables.
We hope it can bridge IT gaps. Moreover, there is a lot of educational content readily available that is widely used at schools in many countries.

## What?

Ebrima and Rob recently took the Raspberry Pi Foundation course [Teaching Programming in Primary Schools](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/teaching-programming-primary-school),
are making use of available learning content and self-authored material tailored to the specific context of the school and students.

## Would you like to help?

We made a start with a proof-of-concept hardware setup, and welcome help in the form of time and/or donations.

## In progress...

We are currently updating this site to make it more useful in helping us to manage the project, organise help and showcase our progress.
We hope it can evolve into a hub of collaboration and knowledge as well as maker fun exchange.
